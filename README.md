# What it Takes to Win
This was my final project last semester.
Football.csv has some important team based states from all teams that were in the top 5 leauges for the year of 2022-23 seasons.

Final_project272.ipynb was where we would make the graphs and compile the data. Where we calculated offensive ability.

What it Takes to Win was our powerpoint that we gave where we presented our findings.
